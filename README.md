# 🌐 IP Calculator + Lesson

An interactive, web-based **IP Subnet Calculator** built with **HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This tool not only calculates subnetting details (like `ipcalc` on Linux) but also **teaches you each step** with a lesson pane.

👉 [Live Demo](https://nemocyberworld.github.io/ipcalc)

## ✨ Features

- **IP/CIDR Input** – Enter an address like `192.168.0.2/24`.
- **Live Calculation** – See Address, Netmask, Wildcard, Network, Broadcast, HostMin, HostMax, and usable hosts.
- **Binary View Toggle** – Color-coded network bits (green) and host bits (red).
- **Step-by-Step Lesson Pane** – Learn how subnetting is calculated in real-time.
- **Copy to Clipboard** – Copy results quickly.
- **Download TXT** – Save the calculation results.
- **Responsive UI** – Clean, modern Tailwind CSS design for desktop and mobile.
- **Toast Notifications** – Smooth, non-intrusive feedback.

## 📚 Why is this Important?

Subnetting is a **core skill in networking and cybersecurity**.  
This project helps in two ways:

1. **Practical Utility**  
   - Quickly calculate subnets like `ipcalc` does on Linux.  
   - Useful for network engineers, sysadmins, and penetration testers.  

2. **Educational Value**  
   - The lesson pane breaks down each step (Netmask, Wildcard, Network, Broadcast, Host Range).  
   - Perfect for students, trainers, and beginners learning networking.  

This tool bridges **theory and practice**, making subnetting easier to understand and apply.
